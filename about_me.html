            <p> Hello! My name is Victor. Thank you for visiting my site. My hope is that you'll be able to browse this
                site and learn a little about what makes me me.</p>

            <p>As for my background, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State
                University. During my studies and work as an intern, I found myself most drawn toward opportunities where
                I could study and learn different systems to the point where I could eventually break and improve on them.
                This preference led me to work in the industrial space, where I learned that I most enjoyed projects
                that dealt with the code that dictated the operation of the various equipment in a facility.

            <p>I am currently working as a systems engineer for an automation and process controls systems integrator.
                Over the last couple of years in that position, I've been able to provide automation solutions to clients
                in the chemical processing,and more recently, pharmaceutical and Biotech industries with an object oriented,
                distributed control system software called DeltaV. I find this work to be work has been challenging and interesting
                and having gained a foundation in this software development methodology I have elected to follow my interests into
                the software space to learn more about software development.</p>
            <p>In my time outside of work , I've focused on  web development with Django web framework. I've gained experience
                with object oriented Python, relational database management and data retrieval with MySQL, front end development
                with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to apply the skills and experiences I've gained thus far to add value in the tech industry.
