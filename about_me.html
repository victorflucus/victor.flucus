<h1 class="mt-5">About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Victor. Thank you for visiting my site. My hope is that you'll be able to browse this site and \
    learn a little about what makes me me.</p>

<p>As for my background, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State University. During my studies and work as an intern, I found myself most drawn toward opportunities
    where I could study and learn different systems to the point where I could eventually break and improve on them. This preference led me to work in the industrial space, where I learned that I most enjoyed projects
    that dealt with the code that dictated the operation of the various equipment in a facility.
<p>I am currently working as a systems engineer for a process controls systems integrator. Over the last couple of years in that position, I've been able to provide solutions to clients in the chemical processing,and more recently,
    pharmaceutical and Biotech industries. Having learned about This work has been challenging and interesting. I have elected to follow my interests into the software space.</p>
