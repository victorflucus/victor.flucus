                <p> Hello! My name is Victor. Thank you for visiting my site. My hope is that you'll be able to browse this
                    site and learn a little about what makes me me.</p>

                <p>As for my background, I have a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State
                    University. During my studies and work as an intern, I found myself most drawn toward opportunities where
                    I could study and learn different systems to the point where I could eventually break and improve on them.
                    This preference led me to work in the industrial space, where I learned that I most enjoyed projects
                    that dealt with the code that dictated the operation of the various equipment in a facility.

                <p>I am currently working as a systems engineer for an automation and process controls systems integrator.
                    Over the last couple of years in that position, I've been able to provide automation solutions to clients
                    in the chemical processing,and more recently, pharmaceutical and Biotech industries with an object oriented,
                    distributed control system software called DeltaV. My role in these projects is to develop, test, and implement
                    code and I've found that I add the most value with my ability to apply a resourceful and thoughtful approach to
                    problem solving. I find this work to be challenging and interesting and having gained a foundation in this developing
                    code in for this industry, I elected to follow my interests into the software development space to learn more about
                    software development.</p>
                <p>In my time outside of work , I've focused on  web development with Django web framework. I've gained experience
                    with object oriented Python,Django REST API Framework, Postman,  relational database
                    management and data retrieval with MySQL, as well as front end development with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is
                    to apply the skills and experiences I've gained thus far to add value in the tech industry.
